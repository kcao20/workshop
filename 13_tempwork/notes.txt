Flask
* Can have multiple routes in one app. 
* Good to have a home page.
* Can iterate through a dictionary with Jinja2.

Egoless Programming
* Working with others is good.
* Don't be afraid to have others look at your code for errors.
* Outside eyes are useful for looking for bugs.
* Reading somebody else's code could benefit your own.
