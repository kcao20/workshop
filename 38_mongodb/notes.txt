- Comparison operators
	- $eq		equal to
	- $ne		not equal to
	- $gt		greater than
	- $lt		less than
	- $gte		greater than or equal to
	- $lte		less than or equal to
	- e.g. {<field>: {<operator>: <value>}}
	- $eq is used as default operator when an operator is not specified

- Logic operators
	- $and		match all
	- $or		at least one
	- $nor		fail to match both
	- $not		negates query
	- e.g. {"$<operator>": [{<clause1>}, {<clause2>}, ...]}
	- $and is used as default operator when an operator is not specified

- Expressive operators
	- $expr		allows the use of aggregation expressions
	{ $expr: { <expression> } }

- $
	- Denote operator
	- Addressing the field value

- Array operators
	- $push
		- add element to Array
		- turns a field into an array field if it was previously a diff type

- Order matters for arrays
	- $all (includes)
	- $size (len)

- Projections filter your results to only the keys you want
	- e.g. db.<collection>.find({<query>}, {<projection>})
		- 0 to exclude
		- 1 to include
		- cannot mix and match except for _id

- $elemMatch
	- matches documents that contain an array field with as least one element that matche the query
	- projects only the array element with at least one element that matches query

- dot notation goes deeper one level
	- zero index

- $regex
