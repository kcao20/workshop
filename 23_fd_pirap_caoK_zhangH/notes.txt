Similar to bootstrap in the sense that it was very easy to implement. All you have to do is link the CSS and JS.
Both of these frameworks have sass to customize the different classes. However, there isn't as much documentation on it compared to bootstrap.
Team Ducks did a good job showcasing the grid system, however there wasn't really any explanation on how to actually create it.
We had to use the official Foudation documentation.

We definitely prefer bootstrap over foundation because it has way more documentation and it looks a lot better.
