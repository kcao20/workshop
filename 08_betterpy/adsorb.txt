Q:
    - Why did you use randint instead of randrange?
C:
    - Imported whole module
    - Manually created weighted random selection. Cool approach.
    - Smart to multiply the percentage by 100 so that you don’t have to deal with decimal points
    - Included other jobs.
C:
    - Writing your own functions would be harder to maintain long term compared to using an active library/module.

Q: 
    - Does the code take quotes that are not matched into account?
C:
    - Cool manual approach to creating a dictionary from the csv
    - Tested code
C:
    - Most likely a slower method/approach

Q: 
    - The total is not 100%. How does this take that into account?
C: 
    - Added try and except for errors
    - Used __name__ == “__main__”
    - Imports methods directly from module
    - Used CSV DictReader and random choices
C: 
    - Will only run if it is the file being runned.   
    - Uses the names for the columns to help with creating the final occupation dictionary. Could have checked what the keys were instead.
